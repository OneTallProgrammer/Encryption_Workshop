There is a mystery number that you must solve
in order to win.  It has been encrypted using
RSA.     

Remember, to decrypt RSA its m = (c ^ d) % n 

m is the original message
c is the cyphertext

The ciphertext is 3

Solving the problems will lead you to the 
information you need to decrypt it

GOOD LUCK!

1. To be XOR not to be

	Ciphertext: 101
	Key: 110

2. Ridin the Rails
	
	Ciphertext: tesnhkyseeeiv
	Key: Get it from problem 1

3. Ceasar Salad

	Ciphertext: upzmpmallu
	Key: Get it from problem 2
	
	* Remember, undoing the caesar cipher means 
	  you have to go the other way

4. Ceasar Salad with Viginere

	Ciphertext: laakmnmf 
	Key: Second word in solution to problem 3
